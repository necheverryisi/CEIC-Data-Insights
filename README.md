# CEIC-Data-Insights

This repository is a project owned by ISI Emerging Markets Group and maintained by the CEIC Data's Research Team. This repository intends to help data scientists and analysts get closer to economic data by providing a simple and intuitive way to integrate CDMNext into their Python workflows. 

Each of the notebooks presented here comes with its own instructions on how to use it. These codes cannot be run from the repository but each one has a link to Google Colab where it is possible to run the code and see the result.
